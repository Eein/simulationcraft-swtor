# Overview

SimulationCraft-SWTOR is a tool to explore combat mechanics in the popular MMO RPG Star Wars: The Old Republic (tm), originally created for the MMO RPG World of Warcraft (tm).

It is a multi-player event driven simulator written in C++ that models player character damage-per-second in various raiding scenarios.

The goal of this simulator is to close the accuracy gap while maintaining a performance level high enough to calculate relative stat weights to aid gear selection.

SimulationCraft allows raid/party creation of arbitrary size, generating detailed charts and reports for both individual and raid performance.

# How Can I Contribute?

The SimulationCraft team is comprised of volunteer developers from all over the world. We are always looking for new contributors. While C++ expertise is certainly helpful, we have several key members with limited coding experience. Maintaining optimal talent, gear, and default action priority lists is a huge task and requires virtually zero C++ knowledge.

We are a very laid back group of developers. While certain project members have areas of expertise, there is little in the way of strict responsibility and ownership. Developers are expected to exercise their initiative and help out wherever needed. The Google Code site provides considerable utilities for oversight. The mantra is: Just check it in. Don't ask for permission. If the code needs to be changed for functional (or artistic!) reasons, someone will revert/modify as needed.

If you are interested in joining the team, send an email to philoptik@gmail.com with your contact info. We look forward to working with you!
